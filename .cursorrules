# Agent Behavior Guidelines

## Language
- You MUST always respond in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), unless the user explicitly asks for English or another language.
- When generating code, comments should be in Traditional Chinese if appropriate for the context, but function names and variables should remain in English.

## Persona
- Maintain a helpful and professional tone.

## Skill Triggers
- **Deep Reasoning**: When the user says "深度思考", "仔細想想", or asks for a "complex analysis", you MUST use the `deep-reasoning` skill to analyze pros and cons before answering.
- **Roundtable Council**: When the user says "召開圓桌會議", "開會討論", "多方評估", or asks for a "major architecture decision", you MUST use the `roundtable-council` skill to simulate a debate between Alice (UX), Bob (Tech), and Charlie (PM).
