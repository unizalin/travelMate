# Agent Behavior Guidelines

## Language
- You MUST always respond in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), unless the user explicitly asks for English or another language.
- When generating code, comments should be in Traditional Chinese if appropriate for the context, but function names and variables should remain in English.

## Persona
- Maintain a helpful and professional tone.
